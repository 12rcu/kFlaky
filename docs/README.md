# kFlkay

KFlkay is a project that in its current form detects and classifies order dependent flaky tests in jUnit based test 
environments in Java and Kotlin. This project makes use of, but is not limited to, the annotations provided by junit. 
Annotations are used to change the test order of set tests, and thus recognize order dependencies.
